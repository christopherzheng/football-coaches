General idea: Query for a football coach's history (e.g. what teams, what positions, who they worked for, who did they worked with, notable players, etc.)


Things to figure out: 
- how to organize data
	- might be easier to start with building csv files for each school and then do transformations afterward
	- should also standardize the tables somewhat
	
Things to do: 
1) Write a scraper to get relevant data
	- Wikipedia -- need to figure out if there's a relevant pattern to links
		- it won't have everything, but it should be a good start
	- University athletics pages

Future extensions: 
- develop an effectivenss metric for head coaches (would be fairly difficult to do this for assistants?)


Coaching positions: NFL generally has 15 assistant coaches, FBS generally has 9 assistant coaches and 2 graduate assistants (strength coaches aren't included)  
1) Head coach
2) Associate head coach
	- this seems to be a figurehead position for extra money
3) Assistant head coach
	- I don't think this position actually exists across the board, but it might exist at some programs
4) Offensive coordinator
-	- it should be noted that some HCs are also the OC
5) Defensive coordinator
	- I don't think that this occurs as often as HC/OC combinations, but it's possible
6) Quarterback coach
7) Wide receiver coach
8) Running backs coach
9) Tight ends coach
10) Offensive line coach
11) Defensive line coach
12) Linebacker coach
	- need to determine if there's a separate position for outside linebackers and inside linebackers
13) Defensive backs coach
	- some wealthier schools might also split this into separate safeties coach and cornerbacks coach
14) Pass-game coordinator
	- this also seems to either be a wealthy school thing or an overlapping position
15) Run-game coordinator
	- this also seems to either be a wealthy school thing or an overlapping position
16) Offensive analyst
17) Defensive analyst
18) Special teams coach/coordinator
	- don't know how popular this is at the college football level
19) Graduate assistants
20) Recruiting coordinator
21) Quality control analysts
22) Strength and conditioning coach
	- this one probably isn't as relevant information
